During my senior year of high school, I decided to take photography classes in hopes to add photo taking and photo editing to my skillset. The two major projects assigned during this class were to prepare and curate portfolios showcasing our creativity, technical prowess regarding photo editing and handling photography gear, and understanding of concepts such as framing, lighting, and colors.

Throughout the span of my senior year, I went out and took pictures at any opportunity I could. I was also able to edit and curate these photos, both at home and on-site.
