During the Fall 2021 semester, the professor of my ICS212 course assigned a major project that spanned over the whole of the semester. This program simulates a bank database with the functionality of being able to add, delete, and display accounts and records. The project was broken up into two parts, the front-end and the back-end. The first part of the project included the user-interface. The requirement was to create a menu printed out to the user displaying the multiple options. The program must then accept user inputs in order to redirect users to their chosen option. The second part of the project included implementing a linked list storing the accounts and records within the database. The program could also run regularly or with debug outputs declaring which functions are current being called.
