## Learning for Myself

Studying Computer Science puts me in a position in which I am obligated to spend hours staring websites, books, and lines of code for hours on end. However, I enjoy learning for the sake of learning. There is something exciting about learning new programming languages, as well as having the opportunity of working on new projects. Knowing the multiple advantages, disadvantages, and quirks of concepts and coding languages is something I strive for, and optimizing my passions and interests have always given me great motivation. Software engineering is just another beast I would like to tame.

```C
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Aside from the intrinsic motivation of learning just to learn, I would also like to develop my skills for more practical means. As of writing this, I have gotten comfortable with programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Javascript, but there is always still more to learn. I also have a couple of Computer Science courses under my belt, learning things that ranged from actually writing code to the logic behind programs. Being able to better translate my logic, reasoning, and understanding into programs is something I has been eagerly working towards. Eventually, I would like to explore other paths that may stem from my education and interests, such as web design, software development, game development, and cyber security. 

## Learning for Others

Bettering myself in all that I do is the ultimate goal, but that's not fun if I can't reap the rewards with others. One of my most needed experiences is how it feels working on a software engineering project as a team. Many important skills, such as communication, time management, and teamwork are linked to this, and developing these skills is very essential to me. Besides working with others, I would also like to work for others. Whether it be assignments for my professors or the occasional odd program my friends want to work on, learning how to serve clients is an important lesson I would like to learn.
