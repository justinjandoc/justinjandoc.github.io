## New Beginnings

Learning is one of the most beautiful things we can do in life. No matter what we do, every 
experience and lesson we encounter has the potential to impact us on a meaningful level, and 
I'll be lying if I said that the past few months of learning has not done that to me. One of my 
greatest joys is applying my various passions into each other. As a photographer, I like to keep 
my workflow simple yet elegant. My camera automatically changes the settings that I want it to, 
and photos are batch editted based on presets I create. It might seem easy, or that I am lazy, 
but this process greatly reduces stress and allows me to spend more time in the moment, and this 
mindset has carried over to my journey as a beginning software engineer.

In today's world, recycling is very useful, whether it be your cans and bottles or things you 
have previously worked on. Oftentimes people come up with the exact same solution to a problem. 
That is just the nature of it, if the same question is asked then the same answer may be given. 
However, as a computer science student, this concept is admittedly a bit frightening. If my 
classmate and I come up with the exact same code, with the exception of a few lines, would we be 
marked for plagiarism? This fear has been prevalent for the past few computer sciences classes I 
have been enrolled in, but that changed when I learned more about open source software 
development. This concept basically means that an application's source code is readily available 
and is able to be reused. My first "real" encounter of this was during my first group project, the [Manoa Organization Database](https://justinjandoc.github.io/projects/manoa-organization-database).
In this project, my group used the open source web application [Bowfolios](https://bowfolios.github.io/)
, and this greatly sped up development as many of the necessary elements we needed were provided.
Being able to constructively manipulate the resources we already have in order to suit a new 
purpose is a skill that will enable me to work more effectively and will give me a leg up in the 
beginning stages of future projects.
