## New Beginnings

Learning is one of the most beautiful things we can do in life. No matter what we do, every 
experience and lesson we encounter has the potential to impact us on a meaningful level, and 
I'll be lying if I said that the past few months of learning has not done that to me. One of my 
greatest joys is applying my various passions into each other. As a photographer, I like to keep 
my workflow simple yet elegant. My camera automatically changes the settings that I want it to, 
and photos are batch editted based on presets I create. It might seem easy, or that I am lazy, 
but this process greatly reduces stress and allows me to spend more time in the moment, and this 
mindset has carried over to my journey as a beginning software engineer.
