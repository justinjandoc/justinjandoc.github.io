## Rule of Thirds

As a photographer, one of the first rules taught is that of the "Rule of Thirds." It is a simple
rule, but it can and will control the way many people aim their camera at their subject. When
taking a picture, there is a grid of three rows and three columns. The sections of this grid
create a guide that may enable for easier framing and composition. For example, if the subject is
facing the right of the frame, place them within the six sections to the left of the viewfinder.

This rule may also be extended into other styles of photography, with nature being one of my
favorites. The best implemtation of this will be if you were to try and take a landscape shot.
Because of the rule, you are required for a subject to fill at least one of the rows or columns
of the frame, so you are prevented from letting the horizon run through the middle of the frame.
This may seem counterintuitive, as the horizon running through the center will help evenly halve
the photo. However, by deciding whether you want the sky or the landscape to take up most of the
frame, you are forced to have a more focused subject rather than having two equal subjects share.

## Patterns of Restriction

While the rule of thirds has provided me a lot of guidance, I have scrapped many shots because I 
was afraid that they just did not comply to this rule.
