##Modded or Vanilla

When it comes to video games, I personally prefer to play vanilla. Take Minecraft for example, 
its community has produced a countless amount of mods ranging from quality of life to completely 
game changing. However, there is still that certain charm that vanilla Minecraft provides, and 
there is something special about playing the raw game that the developers have created. Another 
argument against mods and for vanilla is what happens if you have to switch to another computer?
You could redownload your usual modpacks, but this can be completely avoided if you forwent 
using mods in the first place. Is it really worth becoming reliant on mods?

To use the raw form of anything is always up to personal preference and is typically subjective, 
but deciding whether or not using *outside* resources is optimal is an important thing to keep 
in mind. While the analogy of Minecraft mods does not perfectly fit, we can still use this 
example when looking at frameworks such as Semantic UI.
