## The Good

Learning is a process, and oftentimes the process can be extremely *extremely* tedious. Because of the nature of software engineering and computer science, having another pair of eyes trying to debug why function x outputs y is a godsend. Thankfully with the hyper-connectivity of today's society, help is literally a few keystrokes and mouse clicks away. However, as covered in Eric Steven Raymond's ["How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), there are numerous outcomes for one's query.

Doing a very quick search on StackOverflow, the top voted question has been posted almost 10 years ago, titled ["Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array). Within this post, the original poster poses multiple questions about their code and about the nature of sorting data. Thankfully the poster comes off as knowledgable regarding what they would like assistance on, even providing snippets of their code in both C and Java, as well as writing out their thought process.
