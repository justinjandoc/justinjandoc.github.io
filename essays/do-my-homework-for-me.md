Learning is a process, and oftentimes the process can be extremely ~~tedious~~ fun. Because of the nature of software engineering and computer science, having another pair of eyes trying to debug why function x outputs y is a godsend. Thankfully with the hyper-connectivity of today's society, help is literally a few keystrokes and mouse clicks away. However, as covered in Eric Steven Raymond's ["How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), there are numerous outcomes for one's query.

## The Good

Doing a very quick search on StackOverflow, the top voted question has been posted almost 10 years ago, titled ["Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array). Within this post, the original poster poses multiple questions about their code and about the nature of sorting data. The poster comes off as knowledgable regarding what they would like assistance on, even providing snippets of their code in both C and Java, as well as writing out their thought process.

Such a post is more than deserving of a clean answer, and thankfully the top answer provided just that. The person who answered did not just post a solution, they provided examples, links to further research and reading, and detailed walkthroughs. This person did not need to spend their time writing out what is a few mouse scrolls for some random person on the internet, but it seems thoughtful questions deserve thoughtful answers. This act of reciprocation between these two users shows what knowledge and insight can be gained through asking smart questions.

## The Bad

For every smart and well thought-out question, there are at least a dozen that ask "pls do my hw?". One not so smart question could be found in the StackOverflow post titled ["C File Homework"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20574925/c-file-homework). This question has been closed, as it did not adhere to the guidelines. Within this question, the original poster essentially posts their assignment requirements, pasted the entirety of their file of code, and asks "This is what I have. Can you please help me?" This poster recieved multiple comments and answers, many of which noted that the poster needs to actually know which part of their code does not work. In fact, the top rated answer urges that the poster goes back and add in error checkers in order to see what exactly is going wrong.

## The Ugly (and how to prevent it)

Rereading the two posts previously referenced, I can somewhat relate to both. My interest lies in how things work, so just like the "good" question, I would be willing to pile together what knowledge I have regarding a subject and ask others for help regarding increasing said knowledge. Like the "bad" question, I understand having the urge to find a quick solution to a problem. However, just like with a significant other, you **cannot** cheat if you want things to work out. I personally love finding shortcuts and optimizing whatever I am doing, but reading these StackOverflow posts makes it clear that the path to efficiency may not always be the easiest. Respect is a two way street, and if I want to be answered smartly, I must question smartly.
