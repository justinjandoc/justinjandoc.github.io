## The Good

Learning is a process, and oftentimes the process can be extremely *extremely* tedious. Because of the nature of software engineering and computer science, having another pair of eyes trying to debug why function x outputs y is a godsend. Thankfully with the hyper-connectivity of today's society, help is literally a few keystrokes and mouse clicks away. However, as covered in Eric Steven Raymond's ["How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), there are numerous outcomes for one's query.

Doing a very quick search on StackOverflow, the top voted question has been posted almost 10 years ago, titled ["Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array). Within this post, the original poster poses multiple questions about their code and about the nature of sorting data. The poster comes off as knowledgable regarding what they would like assistance on, even providing snippets of their code in both C and Java, as well as writing out their thought process.

Such a post is more than deserving of a clean answer, and thankfully the top answer provided just that. The person who answered did not just post a solution, they provided examples, links to further research and reading, and detailed walkthroughs. This person did not need to spend their time writing out what is a few mouse scrolls for some random person on the internet, but it seems thoughtful questions deserve thoughtful answers.
